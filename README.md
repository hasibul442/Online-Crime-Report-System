# Introduction
Crime is a part of illegal activities in human life. It is quite obvious that the rate of crimes is increasing day by day in all societies across the world, but we do believe that there is a lot which can be done by both the governments and the individuals to reduce the crimes in communities. The rise of population and complex society rises the range of anti-social conducts that must be restricted by the government through the military and different organizations particularly the Police Force. There are many current crime management systems which faces several difficulties, as there is no means to report crime instantly other than phone calls, messaging or face-to-face compliant filing. The Objective of Crime Reporting System is to develop a web-based program using which people can report crime online. It provides the facility of uploading images or videos of crime scenes to ensure that police may take immediately action. It also supplies the advice of missing persons, most wanted criminals and security tips for the awareness of people. Presently there is no online web application available to report crime online. In order to report any complains associated with crime, people have to contact closest police station. People of the specific city are not aware of crime related matters such as list of Most wanted criminals of their town, newest crime related news, missing persons of the area etc.

# ABSTRACT
